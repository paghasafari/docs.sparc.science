## Overview

SODA is an open-source desktop application, which is compatible with Windows, Mac and linux operating systems. The main goal of SODA is simpligying data organization and annotation process for SPARC investigators. SODA is capable to bridge the existing gap betweenn predefined data standards by SPARC Data and Resource Center (DRC) and convenient application for researchers. SODA will provide an interactive interface that help SPARC investigators through the data organization and sharing workflow without requiring any prior coding knowledge, while automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Therefore, SPARC investigators might be able to organize their datasets following their desired workflow and adjust them with the predefined SPARC standards befor submiting them for review by the SPARC Curation Team. SODA will not only simplify the data organization process, but also reduce subsequent iterations with the SPARC Data Curation Team during review process by minimizing the possible mismatches.

## Features
SODA development has been started from March 2019 and will last untill April 2020, and following features have been promised to be integrated into the SODA:

1.	Prepare required metadata files (submission.csv, dataset_description.csv, samples.csv, subjects.csv) 

2. Prepare dataset step-by-step:

    • Users can specify desired local files to be added in the each SPARC subfolders.

    • Users can use this feature of SODA to convert their files format into the ptrdrfined standard formats by SPARC.

    • Users can request manifest files and metadata files will be generated automatically.

    • Users can validate the prepared SPARC-approved dataset followd by the previous steps using the developed validator by the SPARC Curation Team.

    • Users can prepare dataset based on specified information through previous steps on their local machine or push it to the Blackfynn data portal directly to avoid files duplication.

3. Manage and submit datasets by easily login to user’s Blackfynn account through SODA.

## Applicability

In order to test SODA's aplicability for SPARC investigators, a team of 10 beta testers from various SPARC groups will test and provide feedback to SODA development team to ensure SODA meets the need of the SPARC investigators. 

Non-SPARC researchers can also comply with the predefined standards by SPARC and submit their datasets on the SPARC data portal using SODA. Furtheremore, SODA could impact the broader research community by providing a convenient and time-efficient data organizing approach which could be adopted by other projects.
